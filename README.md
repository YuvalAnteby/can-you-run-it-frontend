This is the frontend for **Can You Run It**, a performance compatibility checker for PC games. Built with **React** and **Material UI**, it lets users explore games and test whether their current or selected hardware can run them at desired settings (e.g., resolution and graphics quality).

> 🔗 This app connects to the [backend API](https://github.com/YuvalAnteby/CanYouRunIt-Backend), which must be running locally with access to the private database for full functionality.
